The SVT will be monitored online using the Java based monitoring application.
The monitoring application can be started as follows: 

\begin {itemize}
    \item Log into \textbf{clonpc19} in the counting house as \texttt{hpsrun}
    \item Open a terminal and navigate to \texttt{/home/hpsrun/svt\_monitoring}
    \item Issue the command \texttt{python run\_svt\_monitoring.py} to open the monitoring app
\end {itemize}
Once the connect button is pressed, all monitoring plots are brough up.
